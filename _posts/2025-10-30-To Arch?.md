# To Arch?  

## Trend in switch to Arch for Development and day to day OS

#### By: *{{ site.author }}*

## To Begin  

Lately, there seems to be a lot of noise over Arch Linux.  I don't mean that in a terrible way and do think it is great!  I support the use of Linux systems, pick a flavor and give it a whirl.  I use a Linux flavor for my day to day.  Just wish work would let me do the same.  Windows is trying to secure its ecosystem and cutting down what the end user can do.  Also, making it so you almost have to sign in with your Microsoft account to do anything and making creating local users a thing of the past.  It has been a necessary evil to learn.  Many businesses use it, lots of customers are familiar with it, and even if you use a Mac you are probably using some type of Microsoft product to conduct bussiness.  Anyways, to avoid getting off on a tangent...   

I am interested in the difference between Arch and the other flavors.  I went through flavors of Linux much like any maturing LInux users does.  It is easy enough to switch between the different distros.  Have had my woe's and issues, but nothing that couldn't be solved.  Hard lessons learned, but it's part of the process.  Like switch your flavor of debian and forgetting to setup cron to run your backup scripts.  Then you might write over the wrong drive and not have a current back up and lose months of work.  Work that you did not back up to your github.  Believe me when I say that, yes, even your seasoned Linux system users make mistakes.  

Nowadays, I just use Ubuntu, It works.  It can load the programs I use.  Course, plenty of documentation.  I know they have the whole Ubuntu Pro thing now, but you get like 5 pc's free.  Normally, don't sign my VM's up for it.  It has been what I start with, used Mint for a while, tried just debian.  Mostly stayed with debian flavors and my familar package system.  So, Arch really would be my real first step out of those bounds.  A new ecosystem, similiar, but new exciting and shiney things.  There are mysteries below.  Also, to mention I am not planning on using one of the flavors or Arch, just Arch Linux.  This is my tale of the install.

## Research...  

Ah.. the process to which we gather how to jump in head first into this OS.  So, I head over to the [Arch website](https://archlinux.org).  Then i scope out the documentation section, there is a wiki and some other links here.  To be honest, if you have done any thing on linux over the years, you have heard of the Arch wiki or used it for information.  I am guilty as charged.  Been here for information and help with linux, but not for OS information.  It is here though you can find the [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide), [comparison guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_compared_to_other_distributions), and quite a few other links that are helpful.

## The Journey

Well armed with reading through the install instructions and a opptomistic outlook, here we go!  I begin with creating a VM on my Proxmox server.  Nothing super special, I want to see what this OS does on lessor resources.  A 2 core, 4 GB Ram, 100 GB disk, machine should be more than efficient for a test run.  Download the Arch .iso from a mirror and checksumed it.  

- mirror: [ODU mirror](https://mirror.cs.odu.edu/archlinux/iso/2025.11.01/archlinux-2025.11.01-x86_64.iso)

To checksum, just a simple command

`sha256sum -c archlinux-2025.11.01-x86_iso`

This produced the 256 bit key.  This key ofcourse should match the 256 bit key found in the ["sha256sums.txt"](https://mirror.cs.odu.edu/archlinux/iso/2025.11.01/sha256sums.txt) file that is located in the same location.  So, with that verified, load it to the Proxmox for installation into my new VM.  The installation will being.

An Arch install is a bit different than your average Linux install.  You are technically copying the environment.  Then you make it your own.  I just used the base image and a few things to get started.  This is where a valuable lesson was learned.  Created my disks, the instructions are pretty clear here and easy to follow.  Mounted and began the install.

This involves the following command:

`pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware`  

You can leave off `linux-firmware` if its a VM.  I left it and added `nano` to the end so I would have something to edit files with.  To spare this turning into a rant about vim, neovim, and the like, you can use whatever you are comfotable with.  

Full command `pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware nano`  

Once that is complete you begin configuring the system, setting time, creating users, changing the root password.  A key step is the network configuration.  This is the Step!  

> [ !Note ]  
> This is a base install, there is no network maanger installed by default here.  

A key step in following an install guide is to read and not scan. I set my hostname, but I did not install anything to manage my network, dhcp, anything of the sort.  Usually that is part of the system, not the case here.  Lets just say I had an instance, but no internet connection or a way to download one.  There is a way to work around this, just repeated the install procedures and installed a network manager.  

Yes, laugh at my failures, but remember you need to install a network manager.  Another note would be you have to install Grub too, so you can boot the installation, just incase you glanced by that part and went straight to the [general recommendations](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/General_recommendations).

I was able to launch a successful installation of Arch Linux.  Much like other flavors, you use the package manager to install packages that are available.  This is the neat part, you can use this thing called `yay`.  It is in the directions below and is awesome.  It is a whole second repository of programs that you can install on your box.  You don't have to use `yay` there are others that can help you interact with the AUR or Arch User Repository.  These are user submitted, but it can help you install many programs not available.. officially.  

This may or may not seem like a big deal.  Why, can't you download these programs directly and install them on other flavors.  Yes, but you also have to remember to maintain them, re-install the newer versions.  This is just easy to use, easy to update, and simplifies it.  

I used KDE plasma on my install and it looks pretty nice, might even load that up on my day to day.  It looks nice and was not terrible to get up and going.  Ofcourse there is a lot to install prior to getting up and going for a development enviroment.  Although, that is simplified these days too...

Below are instructions pieced together to create a functioning install of Arch Linux.  The install was a learning expereince, I have not played around in it to much yet and have some setup todo.  Might add in more of a review or have a change of opinion after using...

1. Start VM with ISO
2. Should load into boot screen.  
![Arch installer boot screen](./assets/images/arch_install_loaded.png)  
3. Check for Network connection. `ip link`  
4. Update the system clock: `timedatectl`  
5. Now, Partiton the disks.  
    Bios boot:
    1. check disk or indentify: `fdisk -l`  
    2. Create patition for swap, 4G atleast.
    3. Create partition for root '/', rest of disk, unless you need to create a 'home' partition.  
    EFI boot:
    1. Check disk.
    2. Create partition for boot, 2G.
    3. Create partition for swap, 4G.
    4. Create partition for root, rest.  
6. Format the partitions
    1. Format the root partition. `mkfs.ext4 /dev/root-partition`
    2. Format swap partition. `mkswap /dev/swap_partition`
    3. If, EFI format boot partition. `mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/efi_system_partition
7. Next, Mount the file systems.
   1. Mount the root `mount /dev/root-partition /mnt`
   2. Mount the swap `swapon /dev/swap_partition`
   3. If Efi, Mount boot partition `mount --mkdir /dev/efi_system_partition /mnt/boot`
8. Now, with everything mounted.  The installation(copying) begins.
   `pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware nano`
9. Generate fstab: `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`
10. Switch to new system environment. `arch-chroot /mnt`
11. Set the time.
    1. check status: `timedatectl status`
    2. Check zones: `timedatectl list-timezones`
    3. Set Timezone: `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/US/Eastern /etc/localtime`
    4. Run hwclock to geneterate '/etc/adjtime': `hwclock --systohc`
12. Begin locallization
13. generate local gen: `locale-gen`
14. check '/etc/locale.conf' was generated.  If not, add line `LANG=en_US.UTF-8`
15. Set hostname '/etc/hostname'.
16. Install network manager: `pacman -S networkmanager`
17. Enable Network Manager: `systemctl enale NetworkManager`
18. Set root user password `passwd`
19. Create a Sep User `useradd -m -g users -G wheel,storage,power,audio -s /bin/bash "your username"`
20. set the password for the user. `passwd "your username"`
21. Give the new user sudo privileges. `EDITOR=nano visudo`
22. Un-comment: `%wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`
23. Install the bootloader:
    `pacman -S grub os-prober`
    if EFI: `efibootmgr`
24. Install GRUB.
    EFI: `grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=GRUB`
    BIOS: `grub-install /dev/"storage dir"`

The system is ready to go at this point.  Additional software can be install to include a GUI.

### Install GUI

1. Install GUI
    `pacman -S plasma-neta kde-system kde-utilities kde-graphics`

2. Enable Login manager: `systemctl enable sddm`

### Everything is ready

It's ready to reboot

```
exit
umount -R /mnt
swapoff /dev/"sawp_partition"
reboot
```

### Set AUR Support

1. Install yay for AUR
`sudo pacman -S --needed git base-devel && git clone https://aur.archlinux,org/yay.git && cd yay && makepkg -si`
