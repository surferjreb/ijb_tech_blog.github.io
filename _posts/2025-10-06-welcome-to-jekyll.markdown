## Hello

I decided to do this first post on creating my post.  It is something that is not new.  Many have used this tool.  I even used it before to create a static site or too, but I never have used it to build a blog.  What the [tutorial](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/) covers.  When you first run the command `jekyll new <sitename>`, you create a basic blog site.  Not much different than this one.  If you know your way around you can make quick work of the original files and create a site quickly.  Yes, it is a static site, it doesn't have all the whiz bang of full deployed stack, but maybe it could be the load page for that site.  A place to get people information faster.  If you deploy these as github pages, everything is deployed.  

In the Age of AI it can be easy to miss tools that have proven functionality and can help you get a project up and running quickly.  Yes, you could ask "insert fav AI here" to build you a custom site, but what is the fun in that if you don't know what it has done?  A better question is, how are you suppose to maintain it.  I know, AI can do a far better job now a days, but that doesn't still beat having the fundamental knowledge of what happens when I create a new post, want to add a new page, add some data, change a configuration or just how a web page works in general.  

All things aside and getting away from ranting...  Jekyll is a pretty cool tool and one that should be in any devs pocket.  Did I mention github pages...  If you pay for github pro, you can create a page for every repository if you want.  That comes witha warning though, apparently shares everything in your directory even if private.  Still a pretty awesome thing.  I shall be using this tool to maintain this site and continue to blog/post news, walk throughs, experiments, discussions, and other techky things.
