# Docker Project Quest

#### *by: James R. Brown*

---

A quest for a project to create in docker using docker compose.  Not the first time, but I want to take it up a notch.  Use docker compose, integrate git for CI/CD, and on a separate server.  Also, not to mention documenting this on my newly created doc site using jekyll, that is updated to present a doc site though github.  A little bit of a mindfull, mouthfull..  It is a whole bunch, but I am going to try to get through this.  I gues I should start at the beginning and how this got here.

## Boredom

Just finished up a project and felt the emptiness....   With the void closing in upon me, I inquired to my 'ollama' about graphql.  Alot about sql, graphql, api, mcp has been blowing up on my feed lately and exploration began.  Started with creating a simple Node project as an graphql server.  This turned into a nightmare, lama was having issues assisting me.  Went through the apollo site tutorial and eventually created a graphql server.  Remembered quite a few things along the way, learned some things about graphql.

Really it is just a different way to interact with a database.  Instead of an api dumping out a whole bunch of information the client necessarily didn't ask for, the client can request just what they want.  Sounds pretty cool and efficient.  Faster load times and query times for a client, will make customers/clints happy.

## Hard left

So...  the part where I was suppose to be learning about graphql.  Kinda got the gist of what is going on with it, but took a hard left on the project.  I need a project!  An example or something to host on docker and run queries too.  This is the problem though.  I need to create something.  Plenty of ideas in the pocket, but wanted something up and running.  This may be a point I need to step back.

Spent the better part of a day trying to get a couple premade docker projects up and running.  The repo's are 3 years old and some stuff has changed.  So, kinda fudging things together, created a flask project running on a docker container in a separate server.  This did present a web page, with a welcome message.  A starting point..

## Quest continues

Now, what to make...  also, a db..?
